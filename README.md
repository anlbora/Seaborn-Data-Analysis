# Data Analysis Program

The Data Analysis Program is a desktop application developed with PyQt5, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to facilitate data exploration, analysis, and visualization. This program provides a user-friendly interface for loading datasets, exploring their structures, generating descriptive statistics, conducting correlation analysis, and more.

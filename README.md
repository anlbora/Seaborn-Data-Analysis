# Data Analysis Program

The Data Analysis Program is a desktop application developed with PyQt5, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to facilitate data exploration, analysis, and visualization. This program provides a user-friendly interface for loading datasets, exploring their structures, generating descriptive statistics, conducting correlation analysis, and more.

- **Column Categorization**: Identify categorical and numerical columns, distinguishing between high-cardinality categorical columns and numerical but treated as categorical.

- **Data Analysis**: 
  - **Target Variable Summary**: Generate summaries of the target variable grouped by other columns, with visualization options.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Visualization Options:** Expand the range of visualization options available to users, such as interactive plots, additional chart types, and customization features to provide more flexibility in data representation.
- **Advanced Statistical Analysis:** Integrate advanced statistical analysis tools and algorithms to enable users to perform more complex data analysis tasks, including regression analysis, clustering, and predictive modeling.
- **Data Preprocessing Tools:** Incorporate data preprocessing functionalities such as missing value imputation, outlier detection, feature scaling, and transformation to streamline the data preparation process before analysis.
- **Integration with Machine Learning Libraries:** Allow seamless integration with popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and TensorFlow to enable users to build and evaluate machine learning models directly within the application.
- **User Input for Machine Learning:** Allow user to input their own parameters to predict instead of random input.
